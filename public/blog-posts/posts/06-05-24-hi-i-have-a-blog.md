## Hi, I have a blog now.

#### June 5, 2024

It's about time.

Over the past six months, I've had a lot of time to reflect. Having taken some time away from the workforce, I've learned so much about myself and what is important to me. I intend to expand on that in a future post, so stay tuned! For this inaugural post though, reintroducing myself is where I'll start!

Hi, I'm Carah. I like to build things that make people's lives a little bit better. After two years I've finally polished up my website. I added a project to the project section, which will be the subject of many future posts, and rolled my own blog! With the help of react-markdown, I can add and style posts with the same ease that I write a README file. Posts also have tags so you can group them by topic as my blog grows. 

What is this blog about? Well, it likely won't be a traditional technical blog. One thing I've learned to embrace over the last few months is the breadth of my interests are all important. If pure high-octane technical topics are what you seek, check out the tags :). If vegan baking tips are what you seek, check out the tags (the odds really are in your favor).

I'm still learning a lot about myself and there's a lot I don't know yet. I'm also still coming up with things to add to this website! A proper Contact Me section will do for starters. One thing I do know is I'm at the beginning of my next chapter, and I look forward to sharing it with you.

Thanks for reading and see you next time

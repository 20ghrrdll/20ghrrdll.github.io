## Needfinding

#### June 15, 2024

On June 10th, I sent my first set of cold emails to the first user group I hope to serve. I was entering with a hypothesis and an open mind, but I admit I was still quite nervous. Oddly enough, this is a byproduct of how much I care about the users I hope to serve. Fiction is one of my greatest passions. I can't count the number of times I've been picked up and dusted off by a book that gave me new perspective.

One day I hope to add a work of my own to bookshelves but that's on a much longer timeline than this project. It was the shift from being a reader to being a writer that highlighted some of the opportunities in the traditional publishing industry. On finding out that hundreds of thousands of books are published every year, my first thought was "what happened to the rest of them?" I found myself saddened that there might be all these books that I would love but never find.

Knowing how much heart goes into books, I was nervous reaching out to publishing professionals. It's grueling work and I worried that asking for a moment of their time would be an intrusion. Honestly, I didn't want to let them down. Yet, from all of the HCI classes I took in college, I knew that _not_ talking to them would be the surest way to do so.

So, I drafted a message in a txt file and went through my search engine of choice to find folks with websites and open contact forms.

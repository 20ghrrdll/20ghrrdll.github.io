## How to dive deeper in user interviews
#### August 12, 2024 

User interviews are only as helpful as the information our users provide. So what do we do when our user gives us short, non-specific answers? It can be tempting to feel that this is our interviewee’s ‘fault’. However, more times than not, we, the interviewers, are standing in their way.

### How do interviewers get in the way?
Presuming that we interviewers already know the [value of a good needfinding interview](https://carahalexander.com/#/blog/post/06-24-24-tips-for-needfinding-interviews), it’s likely that we arrived, having done prior background research, with a list of questions and are ready to listen and learn. So what are we still missing?

We still need to make space for our users to open up. Sometimes as interviewers we luck onto a Chatty Cathy. These kinds of interviewees might even apologize for how much they’re sharing. Rest assured, Chatty Cathy’s, we adore you. The more you chat, the more we learn! However, most of the time, we need to structure our questions to encourage specific and thorough answers. 

As always, let’s consider an example to deepen our understanding of this concept. Here, we’ll take the user group of ‘cursed thumb’ plant owners: folks who would love to live in a jungle but keep killing their succulents. There are many mechanisms that might make caring for plants hard for some folks. We want as much detail on their experiences as possible. 



### Ask about specifics

“When was the last time you watered your plant” vs “How often do you water your plants”
The human memory is a leaky and fallible thing. Save for the rare person who can remember the weather of every day of their life, most people’s memories start to change as soon as they’re made. This [isn’t a bad thing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2013/10/09/176152/memory-is-inherently-fallible-and-thats-a-good-thing/). In many cases, it’s useful for us to not remember every moment of our lives. However, this makes it tough for interviewees when we ask them to make generalizations about past behavior.

A similar problem arises when you ask folks to make generalizations about their future behavior. People are notoriously bad at predicting what they’ll do in the future. It can be tempting to ask a question like “Would you water your plants more regularly if you had a consistent reminder?” Your interviewee might in good faith say, “Yes, that would be great!” Still, it’s possible that wouldn’t pan out in reality. A great example of this is New Year’s Resolutions. Think about how many people start their brand new running routine on January 1st vs. the number that are still running in June[^1]. 

Say we want to understand how our ‘cursed thumb’ plant owners care for their plants. One might want to ask something like,

 “How often do your water your plants?”

 It’s a logical question, but that asks them to cast a wide net over an indiscriminate amount of time. They probably don’t remember every single time they watered their plant over the past year or even a month. There may have been circumstances that made their habits inconsistent. Do they average those times? Ignore them? Odds are you’ll get a vague answer like “a couple times a month, I’d guess”. Of course they have to guess! Our brains aren’t built for that kind of certainty.

So instead, help them out by anchoring the question in specifics:

 “When was the last time you watered your plants?”

It’s much easier to fetch a specific experience than to aggregate across them. Also odds are you’ll unearth interesting details of their practices by enabling them to drill down on one moment. You can ask questions like “What made you think to water the plants?”, “What did you use to water them?”, “Did you do anything else to the plants while you were watering?”

It’s much more valuable to know that the plant “looking droopy” is a specific motivation to water than the fact that they water “a couple times a month” more or less. Maybe they watered their plants with the last of the water from their teapot. That could suggest there is some benefit to convenience for that person. From specifics, we can generate informed hypotheses. They serve as evidence for the robustness of our eventual solution.


### Ask for a tour
In seeking to develop a stronger understanding of our interviewee, it can help to understand the environment in which they exist. What seems normal to them may unearth surprising insights for us. 

In our plant example, we might ask our interviewee to take us on a tour of the plants in their home. The act of describing their space and how they interact with it, can trigger interesting insights they rarely think about themselves. They might point to that plant in the corner that they often forget about. There might be a dust-free circle on their floor because one of their plants is currently draining in their bathtub.

This can apply to any kind of space, not just a physical one. Say they have a spreadsheet where they’ve tried to keep track of their plants and their watering needs. “Can you take me on a tour of your tracking system?”  Say they have a bin of their plant care supplies. “Can you take me on a tour of your plant bin?” 

By putting your interviewee in a ‘tour guide’ role, you’re encourage them to treat everything as foreign to you and asking them to teach you their history and significance. This kind of prompt teases out the things that they might assume are normal. It gives them permission to ‘over-explain’ or ‘talk your ear off. You asked for the tour!

### Teach me how
In a similar manner to the tour, “Teach me how” can be a great prompt for asking about an interviewee’s process. This can be helpful, especially when you’re not in a relevant space for the problem space you’re curious about. Perhaps you’re on a video call, or you’ve met them in a neutral location like a coffee shop[^2]. Perhaps you’ve met them in their office when the problem you’re trying to solve is on the factory floor.Teach me how is great for when you don’t have the immediately availible prompts to reference in the environment.

In our plant owner example, we might say, “Can you teach me how you handle bringing home a new plant?”. They might walk through tossing out the packaging and just sticking it on the windowsill next to their other plants. They might drench the plant in water as soon as they get home. These actions might not seem important to them, but since you’re a prepared interviewer and have already researched your target space, you’ll likely notice the opportunities for followup questions here.

Seeing them immediately add a new plant to a cluster of others might make you wonder about contagions between plants and whether that’s making them hard to care for. You might ask about the last time they noticed any discoloration or pests on their plants. 

Noticing them drench the plant with water might lead you to ask about other signs of overwatering like root rot or fungus gnats. 

Like asking for a tour, “teach me how” puts you in the novice’s role and your interviewee in the role of expert. It incentivizes them to explain themselves further because you’ve asked them to assume you know nothing.


### Repeat the last word
This is a simple but effective trick that I absolutely adore. I think it’s best described via example.

“I love having plants in my apartment but they keep dying.”

“Dying?”

“Yes. I put them in the window then they just turn yellow and wilt and before I know it they’re brown and dead. It’s like I just turn away for a second and then they’re ruined. It’s weird because I feel like I water them plenty.”

“Plenty?”

“Yes I water them after every meal! It’s easy to remember. I eat, then they eat.”

This is a rather contrived example, but you notice the effect of repeating the last word here? It asks for more context. What do you mean by dying? What do you mean when you say you water them plenty?”

By probing deeper here we learned that our plant owner was aggressively overwatering their plants. A system like that would certainly kill a plant quickly.

Of course this is not a trick to be employed too often, lest you sound like a parrot, but it’s a nifty way to ask for clarification without interrupting your interviewee’s flow too much.

### Repeat back your understanding

As a final tip, it’s useful to summarize your understanding every now and again. As the interviewee is talking, it’s both reassuring that you’ve heard them, and gives them an opportunity to correct the record if you’ve misunderstood. 

A key tip here is to phrase your summary in a manner that sounds like you’re looking for their affirmation, rather than like a set of confident facts. Some interviewees might feel less comfortable correcting the record if not given a clear opening.

Consider the following: 

“So you struggle to determine when to water your plants.You’d forget to water them if you didn’t do so after you eat, so you have to water them after your meals.”

Versus,

“It sounds like it’s hard to know when to water your plants. I’m hearing that you’d forget to water them if you didn’t water them after you eat, so you just water them after meals. Does that sound accurate to you?”

Unlike the former, the latter offers several openings in which we, the interviewers, admit our fallibility. “It sounds like” and “I’m hearing” serve to clarify that these are just interpretations of what our interviewee has said. We could have ‘heard wrong’. Closing with ‘Does that sound accurate to you?’ explicitly requests that our interviewee correct us if our understanding is wrong. 

Not only is this reassuring, but it ensures that we have the correct takeaways. Should we have misunderstood, the interviewee now has free rein to set the record back on course. Maybe they feel confidently that plants need to be watered three times a day, because they read an article that suggested it. Or maybe they wouldn’t forget to water their plants if they had to change their watering schedule. This was just the most convenient. 

Each of those takeaways suggests different values and insights than the original takeaway repeated back to the interviewee. Taking the time to confirm means we come away with stronger evidence at the end of the interview.

### So what now?

You have plenty of wonderful techniques to work with, so go forth and talk to people! Once you have a rich range of perspectives and insights, you can take them and whittle them down into a few themes. If folks are curious, I’ll fill that insights process in with a few tips in a future article. From there, we ideate, and that idea generation is the step that we likely wanted to start with in the first place! I’ll tell you a secret though, ideation is a bit more complicated than “What should we build?”. So many exciting things to discuss! Can’t wait to go through it with you.


Thanks for reading and see you next time

([^1]: Fun fact, some businesses build a human’s inability to generalize into their business model! Gyms, coworking spaces, any subscription model that introduces a change in behavior, are all hoping a portion of folks won’t follow through on their future predictions. They’re hoping you sleep too late to make it to the gym, that you end up working from home, and you keep paying your subscription anyway. Tricky, huh?)

([^2]: If you can, try to talk to your interviewee in the relevant environment for the problem space. If they’re a teacher, see if you can meet them in their classroom. A mechanic, meet them in their auto shop, etc. This makes it easier to anchor your understanding of the problem. Remember, what is novel to us as interviewers might be normal for our interviewees. Seeing them in their environment will yield more fruitful observations because we can question something they may not question themselves.)
